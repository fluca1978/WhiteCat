/* 
 * WhiteCat - A dynamic role injector for agents.
 *
 * This project represents a new implementation of the so called BlackCat,
 * a project I made during my thesis degree. For more information about such project please see:
 * 
 *   L. Ferrari et al.
 *   Injecting Roles in Java Agents Through Run-Time Bytecode Manipulation
 *   IBM Systems Journal, Vol. 44, No. 1, pp.185-208, 2005
 *
 * This new approach exploits a completely different implementation, keeping the
 * same idea of BlackCat.
 * 
 * See also the following paper for a better introduction to WhiteCat:
 *    L. Ferrari, and H., Zhu, 
 *    Autonomous Role Discovery for Collaborating Agents
 *    Software Practice and Experience
 *    2011
